# 🚀 Safe Actions State – The Ultimate Next.js Server & Client Action Management Tool

A lightweight, type-safe utility for Next.js server & client actions with built-in authentication and RBAC(role based access control) checks, Zod validation, auto retries if server action fails, and real-time toast feedback out of the box. Just write your DB logic & Zod schema, we handle zod validation, authentication, RBAC authorization, error handling, retries & UI feedback seamlessly. No extra code from your side, just focus on your business logic & DB interaction only! 🚀

## 📌 Why Use Safe Actions State?

As a developer, i know we **hate writing repetitive code for every Server Action**. Every server action requires:

- Authentication verification
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data validation with **Zod**
- Retry logic for network failures
- Real-time toast notifications for user feedback
- State management for UI updates

Doing this **manually for every action** is repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Wouldn’t it be great if all this was handled **automatically**?

**Safe Actions State** automates all of it, so you can:

✅ **Write 70% less code** 🚀  
✅ **Ship features 3x faster** ⚡  
✅ **Eliminate boilerplate** 🎯  
✅ **Improve error handling & resilience** 🛠️  
✅ **Enhance UX with real-time toast notifications out of the box** 🔥
✅ **Handle retries for server actions upon faillure out of the box** 🔄

With **Safe Action State**, you get:

✅ **Automatic retries (configurable)** to prevent failures due to transient issues  
✅ **Built-in authentication & RBAC checks** to prevent unauthorized access  
✅ **Zod validation & error handling** with structured field errors  
✅ **Abortable requests** for performance optimization  
✅ **Live toast notifications** for real-time status updates  
✅ **A clean React hook (`useSafeAction`)** to manage UI state

## How Much Time Does **Safe Action State** Save?

Let’s break it down with real numbers:

- A typical **server action** requires ~**50-70 lines** of boilerplate.
- Manually handling **validation, errors, and retries** takes **15-20 minutes per action**.
- Using SafeAction **reduces that to just 2-3 lines**, saving **~70% of keystrokes**.
- Across a project with **50 API actions**, that’s **15+ hours of development time saved**.

# 🚀 How It Works

## 🔹 Server-Side Actions

### `createSafeAction`

Creates a **server-side action** with authentication, role-based access, zod validation and retry logic.

```ts
"use server";
import { createSafeAction } from "safe-actions-state";
import { z } from "zod";

const adminPostSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1),
  content: z.string().min(1),
});
const adminPost = async (validatedData?: z.infer<typeof adminPostSchema>) => {
  // only DB interaction logic goes here & nothing else, WE HANDLE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF THE BOX FOR YOU!
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
  return { data: { title: "title", content: "content", id: "123" } };
};

export const SafeAdminPostAction = createSafeAction(
  adminPost,
  adminPostSchema,
  ["admin", "founder"],
  3
);
```

### Parameters

| Name           | Type                              | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `handler`      | `(data?) => Promise<ActionState>` | Function responsible for DB interaction and business logic                                                                          |
| `schema`       | `z.Schema<T>`                     | (Optional if server action has no input arguments) zod validation schema.                                                           |
| `allowedRoles` | `string[]`                        | (Optional) Allowed roles for accessing the action. If not specified then all authenticated users are allowed to consume the action. |
| `retries`      | `number`                          | (Optional) Number of retry attempts.                                                                                                |

> **📝 NOTE:**  
> `AbortController` and `withRetry` are **fully managed internally** you don’t need to handle them manually!
> Actions are automatically retried upon failure and can be canceled effortlessly. `useSafeAction` exposes `abortAction` method to abort the server action.

### Returns

- **`ActionState<TInput, TOutput>`** - Returns either `data`, `error`, or `fieldErrors`.

## 🔹 Client-Side Hook

### `useSafeAction`

A **React hook** to execute Safe Actions State from the client with real-time status tracking.

export default function Home() {
  const { safeAction, abortAction, data, isPending } = useSafeAction(
    SafeAdminPostAction,
    {
      toastMessages: {
        loading: "Creating post...",
        success: "Post created successfully",
      },
    }
  );

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => safeAction({ title: "Test", content: "Test Content" })}
